	To translate the colour indications, () and [], of a MultAlin doc file 
to true colours, you can  use Microsoft Word and the MultAlin macro, included
in MultAlin.dot, as follow:

	For a one-time use :
Open your .doc file with Microsoft Word (File/Open)
Change the templates (File/Models... or Tools/Models, Link..., search the disk
 to select MultAlin.dot, Open)
Run MultAlin Macro (Tools/Macro..., select MultAlin, Run)

	For a repeated use, add MultAlin macro to your current model (Normal.dot):
Tools/Macro..., Organizer, Close File then Open File (on the same button), 
search the disk to select MultAlin.dot, Open, select MultAlin, Copy >> into 
Normal.dot, Close.
MultAlin Macros are then available (Tools/Macro..., select MultAlin, Run) in any
Word document that use Normal.dot (default model).
