to translate a multalin doc file to an html file:
- edit the doc file:
	find the line that begins with //
	add the following line
</pre><pre class=seq><A NAME='Alignment'></A>
 	for each line between current line and end of file
	 replace all '][' by nothing
	 replace all ')(' by nothing
	 replace all '[' by '<em class=high>'
	 replace all '(' by '<em class=low>'
	 replace all ']' by '</em>'
	 replace all ')' by '</em>'

- edit head.html if you want other colours than the default ones

- concatenate the three files
Unix:	cat head.html myfile.doc tail.html >myfile.html
Dos:	copy head.html + myfile.doc + tail.html myfile.html

To make this translation, you can use one of the following scripts:
doct2html.csh, that is a csh script
doc2html.pl, that is a Perl script.
