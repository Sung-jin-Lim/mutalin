                        MultAlin : New in the last releases
                        ===================================

        In release 5.3.1, bugs have been fixed and a new output format added :
see "doc Format".
        In release 5.3.2, the mul format has been modified to become a standard
Fasta/Pearson format. In all input formats, sequences can be written with lower
case letters.

	NEW in version 5.4
	------------------
	The pairwise and the alignment processes are modified to handle alignment 
of large families more quickly. In the alignment process, modifications are 
limited to the implementation (no theoretical change). In the pairwise process, 
very similar sequences (more than 80% identity) are clustered together without a 
hierarchical classification and only one sequence in the cluster is compared to 
the other sequences for the global classification. This allow to reduce 
drastically the pairwise step that can be time limiting in automatic alignments 
of large families of sequences.

	Since version 5.4.1, it is possible to align two groups of already aligned 
sequences (profiles) or a sequence with a profile. MultAlin can 
read symbol comparison tables from GCG package, version 9 and upper. The user can
parametrise the doc format.
